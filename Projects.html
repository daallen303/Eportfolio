We wanted to create a task manager that was <span class="maroon">unique</span> and we attempted to accomplish that in a few different ways. For one each task and project has a status assigned to it; new, started, or completed. This allows
the user to see what needs to be worked on in an effecient and well organized manner. Also assigned to a project/task is a priority, high, medium, or low. 
The different colors of the task help the user identify the <span class="tan">priority</span> as well as where they are shown on the page (high towards the top, low towards the bottom).

<!--<span class="description"><p>This pizza website turned out to be a very interesting problem. To order a sub online the same way you 
order a pizza would be either be innefficient or take away from order customization. My solution was to have a standard template for pizza and calzones, Stromboli, Rolls, and salads, and 
a unique UI for the subs.  Another part of this project I am particularly proud of is the admin page. All menu items are stored in a database which allows the admin to dynamically change prices, descriptions, 
names, etc and add/delete menu items without breaking the code, using easy to fill forms with validation to protect the user from themselves.  </p></span>-->

My task management site include tasks and projects. Each task and project has a <span class="maroon">status</span> assigned to it; new, started, or completed. This allows
the user to see what needs to be worked on in an effecient and well organized manner. Also assigned to a project/task is a <span class="tan">priority</span>, high, medium, or low. 
The different colors of the task help the user identify the priority as well as where they are shown on the page (high priority at the top, low at the bottom).
To check out waht the site looks like for a <span class="blue">user</span> use <span class="important">Example-user</span> as the username and <span class="important">test1234</span> as the password or create your own account.

</p></span>-->

<!--<span class="description"><p>This was the first website I ever developed that included a database.
Basically the idea was to design a site that sorts tutors, not just by what subject they study but also by their strengths in those subjects.
Each subject is so broad that a tutor in that field might not be able to fully answer your questions in one specific class. The screenshots to the left show the overall design of the page, very simplistic 
but appealing to the eyes with the main function of the site front and center. The top view includes the site from an admin point of view with the ability to add departments and tutors dynamically. </p></span>-->
